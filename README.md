driftctl-slack is a golang wrapper to send driftctl scan summary to slack.

We've provided a [Terraform module](https://github.com/nomadops/terraform-aws-driftctl-slack) for deployment as a scheduleds ECS Fargate task. 


# driftctl\-slack

```go
import "github.com/nomadops/driftctl-slack"
```

driftctl\-scan will perform three actions:

\* Execute \`driftctl scan\` against terraform statefiles in the specified STATE\_BUCKET variable

\* Send a summary of the scan to the specified Slack channel

\* Copy the driftctl scanfile to the specified S3 bucket

driftctl will be run by the golang wrapper with the following options:

```
$ /usr/local/bin/driftctl scan --quiet --from tfstate+s3://"${STATE_BUCKET}"/**/*.tfstate -o json://"${DRIFTCTL_JSON}"
```

Usage:

```
$ export SCAN_BUCKET=my-scan-bucket STATE_BUCKET=my-tf-state-bucket TOKEN=my-slack-token CHANNEL="#gitops"
$ driftctl-slack
