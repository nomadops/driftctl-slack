driftctl-slack is a golang wrapper to send driftctl scan summary to slack.

We've provided a [Terraform module](https://github.com/nomadops/terraform-aws-driftctl-slack) for deployment as a scheduleds ECS Fargate task. 
`driftctl-slack` will execute driftctl-scan, send a summary of the report to a slack channel and then copy the report to a S3 bucket.

`driftctl scan` will be executed as the following command:

```bash
$ /usr/local/bin/driftctl scan --quiet --from tfstate+s3://"${STATE_BUCKET}"/**/*.tfstate -o json://"${DRIFTCTL_JSON}"
````

Usage:
```bash
$ export SCAN_BUCKET=my-scan-bucket \
  STATE_BUCKET=my-tf-state-bucket \
  TOKEN=my-slack-token \
  CHANNEL="#gitops"
$ driftctl-slack
```

```json
